Impressions of the Learned Material
Author: Buriak Ivan

Throughout the process of learning these web technologies, I encountered several new concepts that expanded my understanding of web development. The most surprising aspect was the depth of version control using Git and GitHub, especially the workflow involving forks and pull requests. Before this, I had only a basic understanding of Git, but now I see how powerful it can be in collaborative environments.

One concept that really stood out was the idea of "feature branches" and how they help keep the main branch stable while allowing for parallel development. This approach is something I plan to incorporate into my future projects to ensure better project management and cleaner code.

Overall, this experience has been incredibly valuable, and I am eager to continue applying these techniques in my future work///
